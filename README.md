# URL-to-PDF-Converter
My project is a Chrome extension designed to convert web pages into PDF files with enhanced precision and customization. While the initial approach considered using the simple window.print() method, I opted for the more versatile html2canvas library to ensure better visual accuracy and control over the final output. Users can rename the generated PDF files for better organization, making it easier to manage their saved content.  

The extension works effectively with static web pages; however, handling dynamic pages presents challenges, especially for platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and Twitter that incorporate infinite scrolling. Capturing such content requires strategic improvements, and I am exploring solutions to enhance functionality in these scenarios.  

Looking ahead, I plan to refine the project further by addressing challenges related to dynamic content, optimizing performance, and expanding customization options for users. This project has provided me with valuable insights into browser-based content rendering and PDF generation, equipping me with useful skills for future development endeavors.
